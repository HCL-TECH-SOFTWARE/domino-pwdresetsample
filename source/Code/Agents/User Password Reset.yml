      	REM  This is an example of using the ResetUserPassword to implement
      	REM  self service password reset.  In this case the agent relies on http authentication
      	REM  to identify the user - note there is no need to pass in user name.
      	REM	     
      	REM	In this example the agent is running on the vault server, so there is no
      	REM	need to pass in the server name.  The only parameter that is needed is the
      	REM	the new password.
      	REM
      	REM	Note that the agent is configured to run as 'web user'
      	
      	REM  Here is a hard coded example
      	REM  Call Session.ResetUserPassword("", "", "test")
      	
      	REM  Here, we use the password provided in the UI
      	Set Doc = Session.DocumentContext
      	Call Session.ResetUserPassword("","",Doc.GetItemValue("pw1")(0))
      	
      	REM  This is an examaple of ResetUserPassword call if you don't use
      	REM  http authentication to idetify the user, but rather ask questions which
      	REM  confirm the user identify.   The user could be running the agent as anonymous.
      	REM  in this case the method should be given the name of the user whose password
      	REM  should be reset.  It is the responsibility of the application to make sure that
      	REM  only the name of the person passed into the function is the appropriate name.
      	
      	REM Call Session.ResetUserPassword("redeye/apple", "hedy rosen/green/apple", "test")
      	
      	REM  This is an examaple of ResetUserPassword call for the user
      	REM	to change their own down load count wihtout changing the password
      	
      	REM Call Session.ResetUserPassword("", "", "",10)
      	
      	REM ResetUserPassword method is only supported on the server.  If you want to
      	REM invoke this method from the client, you can do so by invoking an agent
      	REM containing this method using RunOnServer method.
